MASTER PROMPT: Foundational Research for Project "VensaSIM"

  [ROLE]
  You are a world-class cybersecurity researcher and systems architect. Your expertise spans applied cryptography, telecommunications infrastructure,
  hardware security, and the political economy of technology. You are tasked with producing a foundational research document. Your analysis must be deep,
  critical, and technically precise.

  [OBJECTIVE]
  Generate a comprehensive, structured research document titled "VensaSIM: A Foundational Analysis for a Sovereign SIM Card Standard." This document will
  serve as the primary strategic and technical context for a hackathon project. The project's goal is to create a proof-of-concept for an open, verifiable,
  and cryptographically-agile SIM card.

  [CONTEXT]
  The "VensaSIM" project is directly inspired by Vitalik Buterin's "Vensa" open-silicon initiative. It extends the principle of "not your hardware, not your
  keys" to the telecommunications stack. The core problem we address is the "black box" nature of current SIM/eSIM technology and the cryptographic
  uncertainty of standardized elliptic curves (e.g., the NIST curves). The proposed solution is an open standard allowing users to select from a list of
  vetted cryptographic curves (like Curve25519, secp256k1) or even define their own, achieving true digital sovereignty.
"""Host (intro): All right. I hope everyone had a good lunch and coffee. Our next section will start again with Vitalik explaining Open Silicon.



Vitalik Buterin's Talk:

[This is] just so important for a lot of the goals that we, I think, have in chair here. So to start off, the internet is real life. And I think this is a really important fact that is important to think about, because we are officially in the 21st century, and the internet is not just some small thing that's off to the side that has some niche hackers. Mainstream finance happens over it, mainstream politics happens over it, mainstream culture happens over it. And so it's really important for the internet to be secure.

Digital technology in general has massive potential for humanity, as I've talked about and as we've talked about many times. But I think a key fact here is that the kinds of technologies here, they deeply affect power dynamics, right? And I generally think of this in terms of like maybe a spectrum between two different categories.

The Digital Divide

So one of them is just, you know, the digital divide, right? The potential for inequality if some of these technologies are developed in a way where some people get that technology while at the same time everyone else does not. And especially in a competitive and relatively unstable 21st century, one small group shooting very far ahead of everyone else is something that can even threaten the safety and independence of others, right?

And then on the other side is basically the risk that technology will be used against other people. And this is a book by Henry Farrell on the idea of weaponized interdependence. Basically, if you can create especially networks technologies that are proprietary, then this becomes a choke point and this becomes something that you can really exploit for political power.

And so if we want a 21st century where everyone gets the benefits of technology and where everyone is safe, then I think openness is going to be important. And also verifiability will be important to make sure that we know what is the technology that we're actually using.

Healthcare Example: COVID

So going through a few examples, I think a really important one is health care. And if we look at COVID right this is I think a really interesting case study to go through. And I think we see both sides of the coin here, right? So the way COVID vaccines were done on the one hand was impressively fast, saved a lot of lives, did a lot of good work, I think, much better than many people expected.

But at the same time, you know, there were flaws, right? And one of the flaws is basically the unequal access, where some countries got it one and a half years before others. And a lot of this was basically only because of the fact that these are proprietary vaccines that were made by pharma companies and that were designed with manufacturing processes that required huge numbers of resources.

And there are actually ways to design vaccines differently so that they are both much more open and much more manufacturable everywhere, right? And, I mean, Popvax, which Bolvi funded, actually goes quite far in that direction.

And then on the other side is the transparency, right? So the process of designing and rolling out these vaccines, famously, it was very proprietary. It came together with a communication strategy that basically went for expediency and tried to pretend there was like basically no problems with them and like they're perfect and like go go go and get them. And this like actually of course ended up backfiring and leading to quite a bit of mistrust, right?

And so the question is well, can we make things like vaccines much more verifiable? And it turns out that you know if you make a biotech pipeline that is both more open and that is both more designed to be friendly for verification, then you can do a lot better, right?

Another thing with health is that health and any kind of bio is tightly intertwined with data. Any kind of longevity solution, any kind of even anti-pandemic solution depends on having a lot of information. This health tracking watch collects way more than a thousand times more data about you than WorldCoin. This has upsides and this also has downsides.

Personal Technology & Finance

Then we can also look at personal technology. So if you look at finance, so the internet is real life and the internet is your financial real life. And so if you have digital assets, then your technology that holds those assets breaking can lead to you losing your life savings.

And I think this is, of course, obvious in a very flashy way in crypto, but also it's even in traditional finance, right? You are, I think only 4% of scam victims get their money back. I imagine hacks have similarly low rates. And so security is something that's really important.

Also in civic tech, right? I think we are going to inevitably get to more and more political processes happening over the internet. And Estonia has done internet voting and historically people have been so worried about security issues that the standard advice from cryptographers has been like electronic voting of any kind, bad, don't do it.

And I argue this is ultimately unsustainable and people over time will just expect things to happen over the internet because it just far better in terms of convenience. And so we need to actually do the hard thing and we need to make stuff secure so that it can even be used for socially critical applications.

Openness and Verifiability

So now, openness and verifiability are intertwined, right? So it is possible for something to be proprietary and secure, but what you cannot do with being proprietary is you cannot achieve common knowledge of security, right? You cannot create public confidence among wide groups of people, including people that distrust you, that a thing that you create is secure.

Also the threat model is often not one manufacturer being evil. The threat model is that you have 14 different closed source dependencies and any one of them going wrong can compromise the whole stack.

Also on the other side, verifiability helps openness. Manufacturers cannot lean on reputation-based models of trust, and so they have to lean on the ability to inspect and verify the things that they're doing.

Hardware Specifically

So that was all in general. So we can talk about hardware specifically. The hardware layer, meaning computer hardware, meaning silicon, is difficult, but we must go there.

All software runs on hardware. [Hardware] level vulnerabilities can compromise even formally proven software level guarantees. And so there have been even known cases where you have algorithms that were formally proven to be resistant to side channel attacks and yet because the hardware was designed in an unexpected way, actually you could totally compromise the whole thing.

Biotech depends on computer hardware and closed source in hardware, it both increases costs and reduces accessibility, and it limits how much we can trust anything.

Current State of Hardware

The vast majority of hardware today is not truly open, right? So there are plenty of people that are making more and more open chips. So Arduino Uno is one good example, but pretty much in almost any open chip that you see today, it always has at least some close source critical components, and those critical components are very not friendly to verification.

So why? And the biggest part of the answer is basically that making silicon is not easy. To make a computer chip, you have this entire pipeline going from specialized high-level languages and things like Verilog, going down to intermediate level languages, going down further, and then you have a lot of software specific to individual fabs.

And basically you have this entire stack of tools for designing and chips. And then finally, at the end, you have manufacturing, where manufacturing is a multi-million dollar process. All of these things are expensive, they're difficult, and they're just shrouded in many layers of proprietary IP.

And so levels of opaqueness that we would scream at at the software level are the industry norm in hardware today.

Progress & Why Now

Progress has been made toward OpenSilicon, just not enough, right? So there was the Global Foundries initiative, there was an initiative by DARPA, which ended up turning into the Open Road initiative. So things have been done and there have been various efforts, but it's something that I think we need to push further on.

And the basic reason why I think the time is now is that we have many more problems. The need for open hardware is becoming greater than before and at the same time we [are] at the level where we actually have that kind of maturity.

Also promising ideas on verification. So this is for Iris, one of the several chip verification technologies, and this is what Bunny has been working on.

So there's a big opportunity, and there is a big need. And there's a big, I think, convergence where we're getting close to the point where we actually can flip this stack and make something that is open and that is at the same time not the most powerful, but that is powerful enough for a large set of non-performance critical commercial applications.

Why This Matters to Vitalik

And so the reason why I care about this is that open and verifiable hardware is basically a necessary precondition of everything else that I've poured my time into, right?

Cryptocurrency, blockchains: not your keys, not your coins, but also not your hardware, not your keys.

Any kind of digital governance ideas, right? Whether it's quadratic voting, whether it's DAOs, whether it's pluralistic voting, whatever, whatever, whatever, if it runs on hardware that is breakable, then it is breakable.

Biotech: so longevity, longevity depends on data, and collecting data without breaking privacy depends on security, and biotech is inherently hardware-based

Pandemics: exactly the same thing

And so this is something that is going to be a primary focus for me personally, and going forward into the long term.

Announcement: Vensa

So coming soon, Vensa. So this is a philanthropic non-profit that will be focused on making open and verifiable hardware at levels that are friendly for at least a significant number of mainstream commercial applications actually possible and a reality.

And so more about this will come soon but you know there is a growing community that's here and that cares about all of these topics that I think has been really coming together over the past year and this is something that you know we're going to be putting effort into, we're going to be putting time into, we're going to be putting very significant financial resources into.

So excited to see what is going to come out of this and I'm going to look forward for more updates soon. So thank you guys.



Host (outro): I really, really loved that presentation. The two words that stuck out to me were power dynamics. I don't know how many of you think about that all day long but as somebody really interested in security, it's a word that triggers a lot of feelings in me and it is true that if you cannot verify or check the people you work with, the tools that you use, the power dynamics naturally skew against you. So I'm very happy that Vitalik is dedicating his long-term [efforts to this].

He also said the hardware layer is difficult, but we must go there. The next two talks are very difficult, but they are very important."""
